In addition to any other remedy available hereunder for violations of this chapter, in those cases where the Building Inspector shall have determined a violation to exist and shall have provided written notice of the same to one or more persons responsible under Subsection A hereof, after a period of 90 days shall have elapsed and said violation shall have continued to exist, the Building Inspector may certify the violation, in writing, to all other local agencies responsible for the issuance of approvals and permits hereunder. Such certification shall set forth the owner of the property on which the violation is located and the name of the person committing or maintaining the alleged violation and responsible for the same under Subsection A hereof, if other than the owner and known to the Building Inspector, the nature of the violation and the efforts made by the Building Inspector to obtain compliance. After receipt of any such certification of violation, no local agency, including the Building Inspector, shall accept, determine to be complete or otherwise process or further process any application for approval made for such identified property or by any such identified person or persons or by any partnership, corporation or other organizational applicant of which any such identified person is an associate, partner or majority shareholder. Every such application shall be deemed to be defective, incomplete and not suitable for processing by the local agency, and any time period for such processing or for action on the application which is contained in the Village Law or in this chapter shall be deemed tolled for all purposes. This subsection shall not apply to an application brought to the Board of Appeals for an interpretation or for a variance which would remove or render legal the alleged violation. Upon removal of the violation or the granting of a variance therefor by the Board of Appeals or upon the dismissal by a competent court of all charges which may have been brought by the Building Inspector against such person as a named defendant in relation to such violation or upon acquittal of the defendant by such court, the Building Inspector shall immediately revoke the certification of violation previously issued and notify all local agencies, in writing, of the same, at which time the disability imposed hereunder shall be removed."
