The dimensional standards for lot areas contained in ยง 307-17 of this chapter are minimum standards, in some cases reflecting dimensions that were established by platting in the first half of the twentieth century when there was no Planning Board, subdivision regulations, zoning ordinance or other comprehensive review of land use development. Recent experience has shown that lots created by Planning Board subdivision approval frequently have exceeded the minimum standards due to the nature of the topography and geology of the Town, particularly in areas where there are environmentally sensitive lands. This subsection supplements the minimum standards with standards for land to be subdivided which take into account the Town's environmentally sensitive lands, which include wetlands, floodplains and steep slopes. It is the purpose of this subsection to maintain and protect environmentally sensitive lands in order to ensure the public health, safety and welfare of present and future residents of the Town of Cortlandt by reducing the potential amount of development on vacant parcels with steep slopes, wetlands and floodplains. Standards for development of environmentally sensitive areas where development cannot be avoided altogether are established in other ordinances of the Town of Cortlandt."
