The Board of Trustees hereby determines that,\nin a community such as the Village of Floral Park, comprised principally\nof one-family homes located on one-hundred-foot by forty-foot lots,\nthe aesthetic impact of large parabolic or hemispheric discs or other\nsimilar antennas or devices, measuring several feet in diameter, can\nbe offensive to the residential community and be inconsistent with\nthe character of the neighborhood. If unregulated, such devices can\nbe disruptive to the appearance of the skyline and disrupt the pleasant\nnature and character of the community. Also, the interests of public\nsafety require that such devices be installed in accordance with well-defined\nengineering standards, and other safety measures such as fencing around\nthe base may be necessary. These aesthetic and safety concerns do\nnot arise in connection with dipole antennas, which blend into the\nskyline. The Board also finds that a regulatory scheme such as set\nforth herein allows a reasonable balancing of the needs of the community\nand the rights of persons to reasonable access to television or radio\nstations that they desire and to allow such antennas to fit into the\ncharacter of the community."
