The Board of Trustees hereby determines that in a community\nsuch as the Village of Roslyn, comprised principally of one-family\nhomes, many of which are of historic significance, the aesthetic impact\nof large parabolic or hemispheric discs or other similar antennas\nor devices measuring several feet in diameter can be offensive to\nthe residential community and be inconsistent with the character of\nthe neighborhood. If unregulated, such devices can be disruptive to\nthe appearance of the skyline and disrupt the pleasant nature and\ncharacter of the community. Also, the interests of public safety require\nthat such devices be installed in accordance with well-defined engineering\nstandards, and other safety measures, such as fencing around the base,\nmay be necessary. These aesthetic and safety concerns do not arise\nin connection with dipole antennas, which blend into the skyline.\nThe Board also finds that a regulatory scheme such as is set forth\nherein allows a reasonable balancing of the needs of the community\nand the rights of persons to reasonable access to television or radio\nstations that they desire and to allow such antennas to fit into the\ncharacter of the community."
